# Adrianna Tan's professional site

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Anatole theme](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole) with some slight modifications so that it deploys with Netlify.

It is meant to be a showcase of my professional work as a product management lead, with occasional thoughts on civic tech, public service, and other things.
